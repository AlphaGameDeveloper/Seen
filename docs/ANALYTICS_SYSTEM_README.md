## Overview

The Seen app includes a comprehensive analytics system designed to help understand user behavior, improve the app experience, and provide insights into mental health tracking patterns while maintaining strict privacy standards. The system consists of a client-side analytics manager and a server-side analytics platform that together provide detailed usage insights while respecting user privacy and compliance requirements.

## Core Principles

- **Privacy-First**: Analytics are completely opt-in during onboarding
- **Anonymized Data**: All data is tied to a randomly generated UUID, not personal information
- **Transparent**: Users can opt-out at any time from settings
- **Minimal Data**: Only essential usage metrics are collected
- **Secure**: All data transmission uses HTTPS encryption

## Client-Side Architecture

### AnalyticsManager

The `AnalyticsManager` class (`dev.alphagame.seen.analytics.AnalyticsManager`) is the central component that handles all analytics operations.

#### Key Features:
- UUID generation and management for anonymous user identification
- Event queuing and batching for efficient network usage
- Session tracking with automatic start/end detection
- Opt-in/opt-out functionality with immediate effect
- Network retry logic with exponential backoff
- Local event storage for offline scenarios

#### Configuration:
- **Server URL**: `https://seen.alphagame.dev/api/analytics`
- **Batch Size**: 10 events per request
- **Session Timeout**: 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Max Retry Attempts**: 3 with exponential backoff
- **Offline Storage**: Up to 100 events stored locally

### Data Models

#### AnalyticsEvent
```kotlin
data class AnalyticsEvent(
    val eventName: String,
    val properties: Map<String, Any> = emptyMap(),
    val timestamp: Long = System.currentTimeMillis()

#### SessionInfo
```kotlin
data class SessionInfo(
    val sessionId: String,
    val startTime: Long,
    val appVersion: String,
    val deviceInfo: Map<String, String>
)
```

#### UserProperties
```kotlin
data class UserProperties(
    val userId: String, // Anonymous UUID
    val appVersion: String,
    val deviceModel: String,
    val osVersion: String,
    val language: String,
    val theme: String
)
```

## Client Implementation Details

### Opt-in Flow

1. During onboarding, users see an analytics configuration step
2. Clear explanation of what data is collected and why
3. Toggle to enable/disable analytics
4. Preference is saved immediately
5. UUID is generated only if analytics are enabled

### Event Collection

Events are collected throughout the app using:
```kotlin
analyticsManager.trackEvent("event_name", mapOf("property" to "value"))
```

### Offline Handling

- Events are queued locally when offline
- Automatic retry when connection is restored
- Events older than 7 days are discarded
- Maximum 100 events stored locally

### Privacy Controls

Users can:
- Opt-out from Settings screen at any time
- View what data is being collected
- Request data deletion (future feature)

## Server-Side Requirements
