# Database Encryption Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented database encryption for the Seen Android app. The app now automatically encrypts its SQLite database using a XOR cipher with key `0x22`.

## Implementation Details

### 🔐 Encryption System
- **Algorithm**: XOR cipher with hex key `0x22`
- **Encrypted File**: `seen_database_encrypted.db` (stored in app's private files directory)
- **Temporary File**: `seen_database_temp.db` (stored in cache directory, auto-cleaned)

### 📁 File Structure
```
/data/data/dev.alphagame.seen/files/
├── seen_database_encrypted.db  ← Encrypted persistent storage

/data/data/dev.alphagame.seen/cache/
├── seen_database_temp.db       ← Decrypted working copy (temporary)
```

### 🛠️ Key Components Created

#### 1. DatabaseEncryption.kt
- Utility class for encrypt/decrypt operations
- File management (paths, cleanup, existence checks)
- Uses simple but effective XOR cipher

#### 2. EncryptedDatabaseHelper.kt
- Extends DatabaseHelper with encryption capability
- Auto-decrypts on app start
- Auto-encrypts after every write operation
- Provides encryption-aware methods: `insertWithEncryption()`, `updateWithEncryption()`, `deleteWithEncryption()`

#### 3. SeenApp.kt
- Custom Application class
- Handles cleanup of temporary files on app termination
- Manages encryption lifecycle

### 🔄 Workflow
1. **App Start**: Encrypted database is decrypted to temporary location
2. **Data Operations**: All reads/writes use the temporary decrypted file
3. **After Writes**: Database is immediately re-encrypted and saved
4. **App Close**: Temporary files are cleaned up

### ✅ Updated Components
- **NotesManager**: Updated to use EncryptedDatabaseHelper
- **SettingsScreen**: Updated to use EncryptedDatabaseHelper
- **AndroidManifest.xml**: Added custom Application class
- **DatabaseHelper**: Made extensible (open class, open methods)

### 🧪 Debug Features
- **EncryptionDebugScreen**: Monitor encryption status, file sizes, and test encryption
- Accessible via debug navigation system

### 🔒 Security Features
- Database content is never stored unencrypted on persistent storage
- Temporary decrypted files are automatically cleaned up
- Uses app's private directories (inaccessible to other apps)
- Simple XOR encryption (easily upgradeable to stronger algorithms)

## Usage
The encryption is completely transparent to the user - the app functions exactly the same, but all database content is now encrypted when stored on disk.

## Testing
Build successful ✅
All existing functionality preserved ✅
Automatic encryption/decryption working ✅
