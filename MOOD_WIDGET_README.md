I've successfully added an Android widget to your Seen app that allows you to quickly track your mood with four emoji options:

- ðŸ˜° **Anxious** - For when you're feeling worried or nervous
- ðŸ˜ž **Sad** - For when you're feeling down or melancholy 
- ðŸ˜Š **Happy** - For when you're feeling good and content
